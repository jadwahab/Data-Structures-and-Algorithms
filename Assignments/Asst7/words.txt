The study of economics should begin with a sense of wonder. Pause for a moment and consider a typi- cal day in your life. It might start with a bagel made in a local bakery with flour produced in Minnesota from wheat grown in Kansas and bacon from pigs raised in Ohio packaged in plastic made in New Jersey. You spill coffee from Colombia on your shirt made in Texas from textiles shipped from South Carolina.After class you drive with afriend on an interstate highway that is part of a system that took 20 years and billions of dollars to build. You stop for gasoline refined in Louisiana from Saudi Arabian crude oil brought to the United States on a supertanker that took 3 years to build at a shipyard in Maine.Later you log onto the Web with a laptop assembled in Indonesia from parts made in China and Skype with your brother in Mexico City, and you call a buddy on your iPhone with parts from a dozen countries. You use or consume tens of thousands of things, both tangible and intan- gible, every day: buildings, music, staples, paper, toothpaste, tweezers, pizza, soap, digital watches, fire protection, banks, electricity, eggs, insurance, football fields, buses, rugs, subways, health ser- vices, sidewalks, and so forth. Somebody made all these things. Somebody organized men and women and materials to produce and distribute them. Thousands of decisions went into their completion. Somehow they got to you.In the United States, over 139 million people—almost half the total population—work at hundreds of thousands of different jobs producing over $14 trillion worth of goods and services every year. Some cannot find work; some choose not to work. Some are rich; others are poor.The United States imports over $200 billion worth of automobiles and parts and about $300 billion worth of petroleum and petroleum products each year; it exports around $62 billion worth of agricultural products, including food. Every month the United States buys around $25 billion worth of goods and services from China, while China buys about $5 billion worth from the United States. High-rise office buildings go up in central cities. Condominiums and homes are built in the suburbs. In other places, homes are abandoned and boarded up.Some countries are wealthy. Others are impoverished. Some are growing. Some are not. Some businesses are doing well. Others are going bankrupt. As the 10th edition of our text goes to press, the world is beginning to recover from a period during which many people felt the pain of a major economic downturn. In the United States at the beginning of 2010 more than 15 million people who wanted to work could not find a job. Millions around the world found themselves with falling incomes and wealth.At any moment in time, every society faces constraints imposed by nature and by previous generations. Some societies are handsomely endowed by nature with fertile land, water, sunshine, and natural resources. Others have deserts and few mineral resources. Some societies receive much from previous generations—art, music, technical knowledge, beautiful buildings, and pro- ductive factories. Others are left with overgrazed, eroded land, cities leveled by war, or polluted natural environments. All societies face limits.
What happens in an economy is the outcome of thousands of individ- ual decisions. People must decide how to divide their incomes among all the goods and services available in the marketplace. They must decide whether to work, whether to go to school, and how much to save. Businesses must decide what to produce, how much to produce, how much to charge, and where to locate. It is not surprising that economic analysis focuses on the process of decision making.Nearly all decisions involve trade-offs. A key concept that recurs in analyzing the decision- making process is the notion of opportunity cost. The full “cost” of making a specific choice includes what we give up by not making the alternative choice. The best alternative that we forgo, or give up, when we make a choice or a decision is called the opportunity cost of that decision.When asked how much a movie costs, most people cite the ticket price. For an econo- mist, this is only part of the answer: to see a movie takes not only a ticket but also time. The opportunity cost of going to a movie is the value of the other things you could have done with the same money and time. If you decide to take time off from work, the opportunity cost of your leisure is the pay that you would have earned had you worked. Part of the cost of a college education is the income you could have earned by working full-time instead of going to school. If a firm purchases a new piece of equipment for $3,000, it does so because it expects that equipment to generate more profit. There is an opportunity cost, however, because that $3,000 could have been deposited in an interest-earning account. To a society, the opportunity cost of using resources to launch astronauts on a space shuttle is the value of the private/civilian or other government goods that could have been produced with the same resources.Opportunity costs arise because resources are scarce. Scarce simply means limited. Consider one of our most important resources—time. There are only 24 hours in a day, and we must live our lives under this constraint. A farmer in rural Brazil must decide whether it is better to continue to farm or to go to the city and look for a job. A hockey player at the.Descriptive Economics and Economic TheoryPositive economics is often divided into descriptive economics and economic theory. Descriptive economics is simply the compilation of data that describe phenomena and facts. Examples of such data appear in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a large volume of data published by the Department of Commerce every year that describes many features of the U.S. economy. Massive volumes of data can now be found on the World Wide Web. As an example, look at www. bls.gov (Bureau of Labor Statistics).Where do these data come from? The Census Bureau collects an enormous amount of raw data every year, as do the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and non- government agencies such as the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. One important study now published annually is the Survey of Consumer Expenditure, which asks individuals to keep careful records of all their expenditures over a long period of time. Another is the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Force Behavior, conducted over many years by the Center for Human Resource Development at the Ohio State University.Economic theory attempts to generalize about data and interpret them. An economic theory is a statement or set of related statements about cause and effect, action and reaction. One of the first theories you will encounter in this text is the law of demand, which was most clearly stated by Alfred Marshall in 1890: When the price of a product rises, people tend to buy less of it; when the price of a product falls, people tend to buy more.Theories do not always arise out of formal numerical data. All of us have been observing people’s behavior and their responses to economic stimuli for most of our lives. We may have observed our parents’ reaction to a sudden increase—or decrease—in income or to the loss of a job or the acquisition of a new one. We all have seen people standing in line waiting for a bargain. Of course, our own actions and reactions are another important source of data.Theories and ModelsIn many disciplines, including physics, chemistry, meteorology, political science, and economics, theorists build formal models of behavior. A model is a formal statement of a theory. It is usually a mathematical statement of a presumed relationship between two or more variables.A variable is a measure that can change from time to time or from observation to observa- tion. Income is a variable—it has different values for different people and different values for the same person at different times. The rental price of a movie on a DVD is a variable; it has different values at different stores and at different times. There are countless other examples.Because all models simplify reality by stripping part of it away, they are abstractions. Critics of economics often point to abstraction as a weakness. Most economists, however, see abstraction as a real strength.The describe phenomena and facts.compilation of data thateconomic theoryA statement or set of relatedstatements about cause and effect, action and reaction.model A formal statement of a theory, usually a mathematical statement of a presumed relationship between two or more variables.variable A measure that can change from time to time or from observation to observation.
The easiest way to see how abstraction can be helpful is to think of a map. A map is a repre- sentation of reality that is simplified and abstract. A city or state appears on a piece of paper as a series of lines and colors. The amount of reality that the mapmaker can strip away before the map loses something essential depends on what the map will be used for. If you want to drive from St. Louis to Phoenix, you need to know only the major interstate highways and roads. You lose absolutely nothing and gain clarity by cutting out the local streets and roads. However, if you need to get around Phoenix, you may need to see every street and alley.Most maps are two-dimensional representations of a three-dimensional world; they show where roads and highways go but do not show hills and valleys along the way. Trail maps for hikers, however, have “contour lines” that represent changes in elevation. When you are in a car, changes in elevation matter very little; they would make a map needlessly complex and more difficult to read. However, if you are on foot carrying a 50-pound pack, a knowledge of elevation is crucial.Like maps, economic models are abstractions that strip away detail to expose only those aspects of behavior that are important to the question being asked. The principle that irrelevant detail should be cut away is called the principle of Ockham’s razor after the fourteenth-century philosopher William of Ockham.Be careful—although abstraction is a powerful tool for exposing and analyzing specific aspects of behavior, it is possible to oversimplify. Economic models often strip away a good deal of social and political reality to get at underlying concepts. When an economic theory is used to help formulate actual government or institutional policy, political and social reality must often be reintroduced if the policy is to have a chance of working.The key here is that the appropriate amount of simplification and abstraction depends on the use to which the model will be put. To return to the map example: You do not want to walk around San Francisco with a map made for drivers—there are too many very steep hills.All Else Equal: Ceteris Paribus It is usually true that whatever you want to explain with a model depends on more than one factor. Suppose, for example, that you want to explain the total number of miles driven by automobile owners in the United States. The number of miles driven will change from year to year or month to month; it is a variable. The issue, if we want to under- stand and explain changes that occur, is what factors cause those changes.Obviously, many things might affect total miles driven. First, more or fewer people may be driving. This number, in turn, can be affected by changes in the driving age, by population growth, or by changes in state laws. Other factors might include the price of gasoline, the house- hold’s income, the number and age of children in the household, the distance from home to work, the location of shopping facilities, and the availability and quality of public transport. When any of these variables change, the members of the household may drive more or less. If changes in any of these variables affect large numbers of households across the country, the total number of miles driven will change.Very often we need to isolate or separate these effects. For example, suppose we want to know the impact on driving of a higher tax on gasoline. This change would raise the price of gasoline at the pump but would not (at least in the short run) affect income, workplace location, number of children, and so on.To isolate the impact of one single factor, we use the device of ceteris paribus, or all else equal. We ask, “What is the impact of a change in gasoline price on driving behavior, ceteris paribus, or assuming that nothing else changes?” If gasoline prices rise by 10 percent, how much less driving will there be, assuming no simultaneous change in anything else—that is, assuming that income, number of children, population, laws, and so on, all remain constant? Using the device of ceteris paribus is one part of the process of abstraction. In formulating economic theory, the concept helps us simplify reality to focus on the relationships that interest us.Expressing Models in Words, Graphs, and Equations Consider the following statements: Lower airline ticket prices cause people to fly more frequently. Higher interest rates slow the rate of home sales. When firms produce more output, employment increases. Higher gasoline prices cause people to drive less and to buy more fuel-efficient cars.Ockham’s razor The principle that irrelevant detail should be cut away.CHAPTER 1 The Scope and Method of Economics 11ceteris paribus, or all else equal A device used to analyze the relationship between two variables while the values of other variables are held unchanged.
12 PART IIntroduction to Economicspost hoc, ergo propter hocLiterally, “after this (in time), therefore because of this.” A common error made in thinking about causation: If Event A happens before Event B, it is not necessarily true that A caused B.Each of those statements expresses a relationship between two variables that can be quanti- fied. In each case, there is a stimulus and a response, a cause and an effect. Quantitative relation- ships can be expressed in a variety of ways. Sometimes words are sufficient to express the essence of a theory, but often it is necessary to be more specific about the nature of a relationship or about the size of a response. The most common method of expressing the quantitative relation- ship between two variables is graphing that relationship on a two-dimensional plane. In fact, we will use graphic analysis extensively in Chapter 2 and beyond. Because it is essential that you be familiar with the basics of graphing, the appendix to this chapter presents a careful review of graphing techniques.Quantitative relationships between variables can also be presented through equations. For example, suppose we discovered that over time, U.S. households collectively spend, or consume, 90 percent of their income and save 10 percent of their income. We could then write:C = .90 Y and S = .10Ywhere C is consumption spending, Y is income, and S is saving. Writing explicit algebraic expres- sions like these helps us understand the nature of the underlying process of decision making. Understanding this process is what economics is all about.Cautions and Pitfalls In formulating theories and models, it is especially important to avoid two pitfalls: the post hoc fallacy and the fallacy of composition.The Post Hoc Fallacy Theories often make statements or sets of statements about cause and effect. It can be quite tempting to look at two events that happen in sequence and assume that the first caused the second to happen. This is not always the case. This common error is called the post hoc, ergo propter hoc (or “after this, therefore because of this”) fallacy.There are thousands of examples. The Colorado Rockies have won seven games in a row. Last night you went to the game and they lost. You must have jinxed them. They lost because you went to the game.Stock market analysts indulge in what is perhaps the most striking example of the post hoc fallacy in action. Every day the stock market goes up or down, and every day some analyst on some national news program singles out one or two of the day’s events as the cause of some change in the market: “Today the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5 points on heavy trading; analysts say that the increase was due to progress in talks between Israel and Syria.” Research has shown that daily changes in stock market averages are very largely random. Although major news events clearly have a direct influence on certain stock prices, most daily changes cannot be linked directly to specific news stories.Very closely related to the post hoc fallacy is the often erroneous link between correlation and causation. Two variables are said to be correlated if one variable changes when the other variable changes. However, correlation does not imply causation. Cities that have high crime rates also have many automobiles, so there is a very high degree of correlation between number of cars and crime rates. Can we argue, then, that cars cause crime? No. The reason for the corre- lation may have nothing to do with cause and effect. Big cities have many people, many people have many cars; therefore, big cities have many cars. Big cities also have high crime rates for many reasons—crowding, poverty, anonymity, unequal distribution of wealth, and readily avail- able drugs, to mention only a few. However, the presence of cars is probably not one of them.This caution must also be viewed in reverse. Sometimes events that seem entirely uncon- nected actually are connected. In 1978, Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts ran for reelection. Still quite popular, Dukakis was nevertheless defeated in the Democratic primary that year by a razor-thin margin. The weekend before, the Boston Red Sox, in the thick of the division championship race, had been badly beaten by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Some very respectable political analysts believe that hundreds of thousands of Boston sports fans vented their anger on the incumbent governor the following Tuesday.
The Fallacy of Composition To conclude that what is true for a part is necessarily true for the whole is to fall into the fallacy of composition. Suppose that a large group of cattle ranchers graze their cattle on the same range. To an individual rancher, more cattle and more grazing mean a higher income. However, because its capacity is limited, the land can support only so many cattle. If every cattle rancher increased the number of cattle sent out to graze, the land would become overgrazed and barren; as a result, everyone’s income would fall. In short, theories that seem to work well when applied to individuals or households often break down when they are applied to the whole.Testing Theories and Models: Empirical Economics In science, a theory is rejected when it fails to explain what is observed or when another theory better explains what is observed. The collection and use of data to test economic theories is called empirical economics.Numerous large data sets are available to facilitate economic research. For example, econ- omists studying the labor market can now test behavioral theories against the actual working experiences of thousands of randomly selected people who have been surveyed continuously since the 1960s. Macroeconomists continuously monitoring and studying the behavior of the national economy at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) pass thousands of items of data, collected by both government agencies and private companies, over the Internet.In the natural sciences, controlled experiments, typically done in the lab, are a standard way of testing theories. In recent years, economics has seen an increase in the use of experiments, both in the field and in the lab, as a tool to test its theories. One economist, John List of Chicago, tested the effect of changing the way an auction was run on bid prices for rare baseball cards with the help of the sports memorabilia dealers in trade show. (The experiment used a standard Cal Ripkin Jr. card.) Another economist, Keith Chen of Yale, has used experiments with monkeys to investigate the deeper biological roots of human decision making. The Economics in Practice on p. 9 describes another experiment on trust and gender.Economic PolicyEconomic theory helps us understand how the world works, but the formulation of economic policy requires a second step. We must have objectives. What do we want to change? Why? What is good and what is bad about the way the system is operating? Can we make it better?Such questions force us to be specific about the grounds for judging one outcome superior to another. What does it mean to be better? Four criteria are frequently applied in judging eco- nomic outcomes:1. Efficiency 2. Equity3. Growth 4. StabilityEfficiency In physics, “efficiency” refers to the ratio of useful energy delivered by a system to the energy supplied to it. An efficient automobile engine, for example, is one that uses a small amount of fuel per mile for a given level of power.In economics, efficiency means allocative efficiency. An efficient economy is one that pro- duces what people want at the least possible cost. If the system allocates resources to the produc- tion of goods and services that nobody wants, it is inefficient. If all members of a particular society were vegetarians and somehow half of all that society’s resources were used to produce meat, the result would be inefficient. It is inefficient when steel beams lie in the rain and rust because somebody fouled up a shipping schedule. If a firm could produce its product using 25 percent less labor and energy without sacrificing quality, it too is inefficient.The clearest example of an efficient change is a voluntary exchange. If you and I each want something that the other has and we agree to exchange, we are both better off and nofallacy of composition The erroneous belief that what is true for a part is necessarily true for the whole.empirical economics The collection and use of data to test economic theories.CHAPTER 1 The Scope and Method of Economics 13efficiencyIn economics, allocative efficiency.

When a company reorganizes its production or adopts a new technology that enables it to produce more of its product with fewer resources, without sacrificing quality, it has made an efficient change. At least potentially, the resources saved could be used to pro- duce more of something.Inefficiencies can arise in numerous ways. Sometimes they are caused by government regula- tions or tax laws that distort otherwise sound economic decisions. Suppose that land in Ohio is best suited for corn production and that land in Kansas is best suited for wheat production. A law that requires Kansas to produce only corn and Ohio to produce only wheat would be inefficient. If firms that cause environmental damage are not held accountable for their actions, the incentive to minimize those damages is lost and the result is inefficient.In Figure II.1, much of the detail of the real world is stripped away just as it is on a highway map. A map is a highly simplified version of reality, but it is a very useful tool when you need to know where you are. Figure II.1 is intended to serve as a map to help you understand basic market forces before we add more complicated market structures and government.Before we proceed with our discussion of household choice, we need to make a few basic assumptions. These assumptions pertain to Chapters 6 through 12.We first assume that households and firms possess all the information they need to make market choices. Specifically, we assume that households possess knowledge of the qualities and prices of everything available in the market. Firms know all that there is to know about wage rates, capital costs, and output prices. This assumption is often called the assumption of perfect knowledge.The next assumption is perfect competition. Perfect competition is a precisely defined form of industry structure. (The word perfect here does not refer to virtue. It simply means “total” or “complete.”) In a perfectly competitive industry, no single firm has control over prices. That is, no single firm is large enough to affect the market price of its product or the prices of the inputs that it buys. This follows from two characteristics of competitive indus- tries. First, a competitive industry is composed of many firms, each one small relative to the size of the industry. Second, every firm in a perfectly competitive industry produces exactly the same product; the output of one firm cannot be distinguished from the output of the others. Products in a perfectly competitive industry are said to be homogeneous.These characteristics limit the decisions open to competitive firms and simplify the analysis of competitive behavior. Because all firms in a perfectly competitive industry pro- duce virtually identical products and because each firm is small relative to the market, per- fectly competitive firms have no control over the prices at which they sell their output. By taking prices as a given, each firm can decide only how much output to produce and how to produce it.Consider agriculture, the classic example of a perfectly competitive industry. A wheat farmer in South Dakota has absolutely no control over the price of wheat. Prices are deter- mined not by the individual farmers, but by the interaction of many suppliers and many demanders. The only decisions left to the wheat farmer are how much wheat to plant and when and how to produce the crop.We finally assume that each household is small relative to the size of the market. Households face a set of product prices that they individually cannot control. Prices again are set by the interaction of many suppliers and many demanders.By the end of Chapter 10, we will have a complete picture of an economy, but it will be based on this set of fairly restrictive assumptions. At first, this may seem unrealistic to you, but keep the following in mind. Much of the economic analysis in the chapters that follow applies to all forms of market structure. Indeed, much of the power of economic reasoning is that it is quite general. As we continue in microeconomics, in Chapters 13 and 14, we will define and explore several different kinds of market organization and structure, including monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. Because monopolists, oligopolists, monopolistic competitors, and perfect competitors share the objective of maximizing prof- its, it should not be surprising that their behavior is in many ways similar. We focus here on perfect competition because many of these basic principles are easier to learn using the sim- plest of cases.Every day people in a market econ-omy make decisions. Some of thosedecisions involve the products theyplan to buy: Should you buy a Cokefor lunch, a bottle of tea, or justdrink water? Should you purchase alaptop computer or stick with yourold desktop? Some decisions areabout the labor market: Should youcontinue your schooling or go towork instead? If you do start work-ing, how much should you work?Should you work more when youget a raise or just take it easy? Manydecisions involve a time element. Ifor borrow money. That will leave you with fewer choices about what you can buy in the future. On the other hand, the laptop itself is an investment.To many people, the decisions listed in the previous paragraph seem very different from one another. As you will see in this chapter, however, from an economics perspective, these decisions have a great deal in common. In this chapter, we will develop a set of principles that can be used to under- stand decisions in the product market and the labor market—decisions for today and for the future.As you read this chapter, you might want to think about some of the following questions, ques- tions that you will be able to answer by chapter’s end. Baseball, even when it was more popular than it is today, was never played year-round. Indeed, no professional sport has a year-round season. Is this break necessary to give the athletes a rest, or is there something about household choice that helps explain this pattern? When the price of gasoline rises, people drive less, but one study suggests that they also switch from brand name products to generics or store brands.1 Why might this be? Studying household choice will help you understand many decisions that underpin our market economy.A constant theme that will run through the analysis is the idea of constrained choice. That is, the decisions that we make we make under constraints that exist in the marketplace. Household consumption choices are constrained by income, wealth, and existing prices. Household deci- sions about labor supply and job choice are clearly constrained by the availability of jobs. This was on everyone’s minds when the number of unemployed reached 15 million and the unem- ployment rate hovered at about 10 percent during the 2009–2010 period. In addition, the choices we make in the workforce are constrained by the existing structure of market wages.
A careful search of the housing market reveals four vacant apartments. The least expensive is a one-room studio with a small kitchenette that rents for $400 per month, including utilities (option A). If she lived there, Barbara could afford to spend $250 per month on food and still have $350 left over for other things.About four blocks away is a one-bedroom apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and a larger kitchen. It has more space, but the rent is $600, including utilities. If Barbara took this apartment, she might cut her food expenditures by $50 per month and have only $200 per month left for everything else.In the same building as the one-bedroom apartment is an identical unit on the top floor of the building with a balcony facing west toward the sunset. The balcony and view add $100 to the monthly rent. To live there, Barbara would be left with only $300 to split between food and other expenses.Just because she was curious, Barbara looked at a town house in the suburbs that was renting for $1,000 per month. Obviously, unless she could get along without eating or doing anything else that cost money, she could not afford it. The combination of the town house and any amount of food is outside her budget constraint.Notice that we have used the information that we have on income and prices to identify dif- ferent combinations of housing, food, and other items that are available to a single-person house- hold with an income of $1,000 per month. We have said nothing about the process of choosing. Instead, we have carved out what is called a choice set or opportunity set, the set of options that is defined and limited by Barbara’s budget constraint.Preferences, Tastes, Trade-Offs, and Opportunity Cost So far, we have identi- fied only the combinations of goods and services that are and are not available to Barbara. Within the constraints imposed by limited incomes and fixed prices, however, households are free to choose what they will and will not buy. Their ultimate choices are governed by their individual preferences and tastes.It will help you to think of the household choice process as a process of allocating income over a large number of available goods and services. Final demand of a household for any single product is just one of many outcomes that result from the decision-making process. Think, for example, of a demand curve that shows a household’s reaction to a drop in the price of air travel. During certain periods when people travel less frequently, special fares flood the market and many people decide to take trips that they otherwise would not have taken. However, if you live in Florida and decide to spend $400 to visit your mother in Nashville, you cannot spend that $400 on new clothes, dinners at restaurants, or a new set of tires.A change in the price of a single good changes the constraints within which households choose, and this may change the entire allocation of income. Demand for some goods and services may rise while demand for others falls. A complicated set of trade-offs lies behind the shape and position of a household demand curve for a single good. Whenever a household makes a choice, it is weighing the good or service that it chooses against all the other things that the same money could buy.Consider again our young account manager and her options listed in Table 6.1. If she hates to cook, likes to eat at restaurants, and goes out three nights a week, she will probably trade off some housing for dinners out and money to spend on clothes and other things. She will probably rent the studio for $400. She may, however, love to spend long evenings at home reading, listen- ing to classical music, and sipping tea while watching the sunset. In that case, she will probably trade off some restaurant meals, evenings out, and travel expenses for the added comfort of the larger apartment with the balcony and the view. As long as a household faces a limited budget— and all households ultimately do—the real cost of any good or service is the value of the other goods and services that could have been purchased with the same amount of money. The real cost of a good or service is its opportunity cost, and opportunity cost is determined by relative prices.The Budget Constraint More Formally Ann and Tom are struggling graduate stu- dents in economics at the University of Virginia. Their tuition is paid by graduate fellowships. They live as resident advisers in a first-year dormitory, in return for which they receive an apart- ment and meals. Their fellowships also give them $200 each month to cover all their other expenses. To simplify things, let us assume that Ann and Tom spend their money on only two things: meals at a local Thai restaurant and nights at a local jazz club, The Hungry Ear. Thai meals go for a fixed price of $20 per couple. Two tickets to the jazz club, including espresso, are $10.As Figure 6.1 shows, we can graphically depict the choices that are available to our dynamic duo. The axes measure the quantities of the two goods that Ann and Tom buy. The horizontal axischoice set or opportunityset The set of options that is defined and limited by a budget constraint.
The reason we take opportunity costs into account is that we are interested in analyzing the behavior of firms from the standpoint of a potential investor or a potential new competitor. If I am thinking about buying a firm or shares in a firm or entering an industry as a new firm, I need to consider the full costs of production. For example, if a family business employs three family members but pays them no wage, there is still a cost: the opportunity cost of their labor. In eval- uating the business from the outside, these costs must be added if we want to figure out whether the business is successful.The most important opportunity cost that is included in economic cost is the opportunity cost of capital. The way we treat the opportunity cost of capital is to add a normal rate of return to capital as part of economic cost.Normal Rate of Return When someone decides to start a firm, that person must com- mit resources. To operate a manufacturing firm, you need a plant and some equipment. To start a restaurant, you need to buy grills, ovens, tables, chairs, and so on. In other words, you must invest in capital. To start an e-business, you need a host site, some computer equipment, some software, and a Web-site design. Such investment requires resources that stay tied up in the firm as long as it operates. Even firms that have been around a long time must continue to invest. Plant and equipment wear out and must be replaced. Firms that decide to expand must put new capital in place. This is as true of proprietorships, where the resources come directly from the proprietor, as it is of corporations, where the resources needed to make investments come from shareholders.Whenever resources are used to invest in a business, there is an opportunity cost. Instead of opening a candy store, you could put your funds into an alternative use such as a certificate of deposit or a government bond, both of which earn interest. Instead of using its retained earnings to build a new plant, a firm could earn interest on those funds or pay them out to shareholders.Rate of return is the annual flow of net income generated by an investment expressed as a percentage of the total investment. For example, if someone makes a $100,000 investment in cap- ital to start a small restaurant and the restaurant produces a flow of profit of $15,000 every year, we say the project has a “rate of return” of 15 percent. Sometimes we refer to the rate of return as the yield of the investment.A normal rate of return is the rate that is just sufficient to keep owners and investors satis- fied. If the rate of return were to fall below normal, it would be difficult or impossible for managers to raise resources needed to purchase new capital. Owners of the firm would be receiving a rate of return that was lower than what they could receive elsewhere in the economy, and they would have no incentive to invest in the firm.If the firm has fairly steady revenues and the future looks secure, the normal rate of return should be very close to the interest rate on risk-free government bonds. A firm cer- tainly will not keep investors interested in it if it does not pay them a rate of return at least as high as they can get from a risk-free government or corporate bond. If a firm is rock solid and the economy is steady, it may not have to pay a much higher rate. However, if a firm is in a very speculative industry and the future of the economy is shaky, it may have to pay sub- stantially more to keep its shareholders happy. In exchange for a risk that the business may fal- ter or even fail, the shareholders will expect a higher return.A normal rate of return is considered a part of the total cost of a business. Adding a normal rate of return to total cost has an important implication: When a firm earns a normal rate of return, it is earning a zero profit as we have defined profit. If the level of profit is positive, the firm is earning an above-normal rate of return on capital.A simple example will illustrate the concepts of a normal rate of return being part of total cost. Suppose that Sue and Ann decide to start a small business selling turquoise belts in the Denver airport. To get into the business, they need to invest in a fancy pushcart. The price of the pushcart is $20,000 with all the displays and attachments included. Suppose that Sue and Ann estimate that they will sell 3,000 belts each year for $10 each. Further assume that each belt costs $5 from the supplier. Finally, the cart must be staffed by one clerk, who works for an annual wage of $14,000. Is this business going to make a profit?To answer this question, we must determine total revenue and total cost. First, annual rev- enue is $30,000 (3,000 belts 􏰈 $10). Total cost includes the cost of the belts—$15,000 (3,000 belts 􏰈 $5)—plus the labor cost of $14,000, for a total of $29,000. Thus, on the basis of the annual rev- enue and cost flows, the firm seems to be making a profit of $1,000 ($30,000 - $29,000).normal rate of returnCHAPTER 7 The Production Process: The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms149A rate of return on capital that is justsufficient to keep owners and investors satisfied. For relatively risk-free firms, it should be nearly the same as the interest rate on risk-free government bonds.
150 PART IIThe Market System: Choices Made by Households and FirmsWhat about the $20,000 initial investment in the pushcart? This investment is not a direct part of the cost of Sue and Ann’s firm. If we assume that the cart maintains its value over time, the only thing that Sue and Ann are giving up is the interest they might have earned had they not tied up their funds in the pushcart. That is, the only real cost is the opportunity cost of the investment, which is the forgone interest on the $20,000.Now suppose that Sue and Ann want a minimum return equal to 10 percent—which is, say, the rate of interest that they could have gotten by purchasing corporate bonds. This implies a nor- mal return of 10 percent, or $2,000 annually (= $20,000 􏰈 0.10) on the $20,000 investment. As we determined earlier, Sue and Ann will earn only $1,000 annually. This is only a 5 percent return on their investment. Thus, they are really earning a below-normal return. Recall that the opportunity cost of capital must be added to total cost in calculating profit. Thus, the total cost in this case is $31,000 ($29,000 + $2,000 in forgone interest on the investment). The level of profit is negative: $30,000 minus $31,000 equals –$1,000. These calculations are summarized in Table 7.1. Because the level of profit is negative, Sue and Ann are actually suffering a loss on their belt business.
The decisions made by a firm—how much to produce, how to produce it, and what inputs to demand—all take time into account. If a firm decides that it wants to double or triple its output, it may need time to arrange financing, hire architects and contractors, and build a new plant. Planning for a major expansion can take years. In the meantime, the firm must decide how much to produce within the constraint of its existing plant. If a firm decides to get out of a particular business, it may take time to arrange an orderly exit. There may be contract obligations to fulfill, equipment to sell, and so on. Once again, the firm must decide what to do in the meantime.A firm’s immediate response to a change in the economic environment may differ from its response over time. Consider, for example, a small restaurant with 20 tables that becomes very popular. The immediate problem for the owners is getting the most profit within the constraint of the existing restaurant. The owner might consider adding a few tables or speeding up service to squeeze in a few more customers. Some popular restaurants do not take reservations, forcing people to wait at the bar. This practice increases drink revenues and keeps tables full at all times. At the same time, the owner may be thinking of expanding the current facility, moving to a larger facility, or opening a second restaurant. In the future, the owner might buy the store next door and double the capacity. Such decisions might require negotiating a lease, buying new equip- ment, and hiring more staff. It takes time to make and implement these decisions.
Because the character of immediate response differs from long-run adjustment, it is useful to define two time periods: the short run and the long run. Two assumptions define the short run: (1) a fixed scale (or a fixed factor of production) and (2) no entry into or exit from the industry. First, the short run is defined as that period during which existing firms have some fixed factor of production—that is, during which time some factor locks them into their current scale of opera- tions. Second, new firms cannot enter and existing firms cannot exit an industry in the short run. Firms may curtail operations, but they are still locked into some costs even though they may be in the process of going out of business.Which factor or factors of production are fixed in the short run differs from industry to industry. For a manufacturing firm, the size of the physical plant is often the greatest limitation. A factory is built with a given production rate in mind. Although that rate can be increased, out- put cannot increase beyond a certain limit in the short run. For a private physician, the limit may be the capacity to see patients; the day has only so many hours. In the long run, the doctor may invite others to join the practice and expand; but for now, in the short run, this sole physician is the firm, with a capacity that is the firm’s only capacity. For a farmer, the fixed factor may be land. The capacity of a small farm is limited by the number of acres being cultivated.In the long run, there are no fixed factors of production. Firms can plan for any output level they find desirable. They can double or triple output, for example. In addition, new firms can start up operations (enter the industry) and existing firms can go out of business (exit the industry).No hard-and-fast rule specifies how long the short run is. The point is that firms make two basic kinds of decisions: those that govern the day-to-day operations of the firm and those that involve longer-term strategic planning. Sometimes major decisions can be implemented in weeks. Often, however, the process takes years. In many large firms, different people often make the short- and long-run decisions. A production manager might well be charged with trying to do the best she can with the plant and equipment that she has, while her boss, the division head, figures out whether expansion of the plant is a good idea. In a single proprietorship, one person may wear both hats, thinking simultaneously about how to make the most out of the present while taking steps to improve the future of the business.The Bases of Decisions: Market Price of Outputs, AvailableTechnology, and Input PricesAs we said earlier, a firm’s three fundamental decisions are made with the objective of maximiz- ing profits. Because profits equal total revenues minus total costs, each firm needs to know how much it costs to produce its product and how much its product can be sold for.To know how much it costs to produce a good or service, a firm needs to know something about the production techniques that are available and about the prices of the inputs required. To estimate how much it will cost to operate a gas station, for instance, a firm needs to know equipment needs, number of workers, kind of building, and so on. The firm also needs to know the going wage rates for mechanics and unskilled laborers, the cost of gas pumps, interest rates, the rents per square foot of land on high-traffic corners, and the whole- sale price of gasoline. Of course, the firm also needs to know how much it can sell gasoline and repair services for.In the language of economics, a firm needs to know three things:1. Themarketpriceofoutput2. Thetechniquesofproductionthatareavailable 3. ThepricesofinputsOutput price determines potential revenues. The techniques available tell me how much of each input I need, and input prices tell me how much they will cost. Together the available production techniques and the prices of inputs determine costs.The rest of this chapter and the next chapter focus on costs of production. We begin at the heart of the firm, with the production process. Faced with a set of input prices, firms must decide on the best, or optimal, method of production (Figure 7.2). The optimal method of production is the one that minimizes cost. With cost determined and the market price of output known, a firm will make a final judgment about the quantity of product to produce and the quantity of each input to demand.The study of economics should begin with a sense of wonder. Pause for a moment and consider a typi- cal day in your life. It might start with a bagel made in a local bakery with flour produced in Minnesota from wheat grown in Kansas and bacon from pigs raised in Ohio packaged in plastic made in New Jersey. You spill coffee from Colombia on your shirt made in Texas from textiles shipped from South Carolina.After class you drive with afriend on an interstate highway that is part of a system that took 20 years and billions of dollars to build. You stop for gasoline refined in Louisiana from Saudi Arabian crude oil brought to the United States on a supertanker that took 3 years to build at a shipyard in Maine.Later you log onto the Web with a laptop assembled in Indonesia from parts made in China and Skype with your brother in Mexico City, and you call a buddy on your iPhone with parts from a dozen countries. You use or consume tens of thousands of things, both tangible and intan- gible, every day: buildings, music, staples, paper, toothpaste, tweezers, pizza, soap, digital watches, fire protection, banks, electricity, eggs, insurance, football fields, buses, rugs, subways, health ser- vices, sidewalks, and so forth. Somebody made all these things. Somebody organized men and women and materials to produce and distribute them. Thousands of decisions went into their completion. Somehow they got to you.In the United States, over 139 million people—almost half the total population—work at hundreds of thousands of different jobs producing over $14 trillion worth of goods and services every year. Some cannot find work; some choose not to work. Some are rich; others are poor.The United States imports over $200 billion worth of automobiles and parts and about $300 billion worth of petroleum and petroleum products each year; it exports around $62 billion worth of agricultural products, including food. Every month the United States buys around $25 billion worth of goods and services from China, while China buys about $5 billion worth from the United States. High-rise office buildings go up in central cities. Condominiums and homes are built in the suburbs. In other places, homes are abandoned and boarded up.Some countries are wealthy. Others are impoverished. Some are growing. Some are not. Some businesses are doing well. Others are going bankrupt. As the 10th edition of our text goes to press, the world is beginning to recover from a period during which many people felt the pain of a major economic downturn. In the United States at the beginning of 2010 more than 15 million people who wanted to work could not find a job. Millions around the world found themselves with falling incomes and wealth.At any moment in time, every society faces constraints imposed by nature and by previous generations. Some societies are handsomely endowed by nature with fertile land, water, sunshine, and natural resources. Others have deserts and few mineral resources. Some societies receive much from previous generations—art, music, technical knowledge, beautiful buildings, and pro- ductive factories. Others are left with overgrazed, eroded land, cities leveled by war, or polluted natural environments. All societies face limits.
What happens in an economy is the outcome of thousands of individ- ual decisions. People must decide how to divide their incomes among all the goods and services available in the marketplace. They must decide whether to work, whether to go to school, and how much to save. Businesses must decide what to produce, how much to produce, how much to charge, and where to locate. It is not surprising that economic analysis focuses on the process of decision making.Nearly all decisions involve trade-offs. A key concept that recurs in analyzing the decision- making process is the notion of opportunity cost. The full “cost” of making a specific choice includes what we give up by not making the alternative choice. The best alternative that we forgo, or give up, when we make a choice or a decision is called the opportunity cost of that decision.When asked how much a movie costs, most people cite the ticket price. For an econo- mist, this is only part of the answer: to see a movie takes not only a ticket but also time. The opportunity cost of going to a movie is the value of the other things you could have done with the same money and time. If you decide to take time off from work, the opportunity cost of your leisure is the pay that you would have earned had you worked. Part of the cost of a college education is the income you could have earned by working full-time instead of going to school. If a firm purchases a new piece of equipment for $3,000, it does so because it expects that equipment to generate more profit. There is an opportunity cost, however, because that $3,000 could have been deposited in an interest-earning account. To a society, the opportunity cost of using resources to launch astronauts on a space shuttle is the value of the private/civilian or other government goods that could have been produced with the same resources.Opportunity costs arise because resources are scarce. Scarce simply means limited. Consider one of our most important resources—time. There are only 24 hours in a day, and we must live our lives under this constraint. A farmer in rural Brazil must decide whether it is better to continue to farm or to go to the city and look for a job. A hockey player at the.Descriptive Economics and Economic TheoryPositive economics is often divided into descriptive economics and economic theory. Descriptive economics is simply the compilation of data that describe phenomena and facts. Examples of such data appear in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a large volume of data published by the Department of Commerce every year that describes many features of the U.S. economy. Massive volumes of data can now be found on the World Wide Web. As an example, look at www. bls.gov (Bureau of Labor Statistics).Where do these data come from? The Census Bureau collects an enormous amount of raw data every year, as do the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and non- government agencies such as the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. One important study now published annually is the Survey of Consumer Expenditure, which asks individuals to keep careful records of all their expenditures over a long period of time. Another is the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Force Behavior, conducted over many years by the Center for Human Resource Development at the Ohio State University.Economic theory attempts to generalize about data and interpret them. An economic theory is a statement or set of related statements about cause and effect, action and reaction. One of the first theories you will encounter in this text is the law of demand, which was most clearly stated by Alfred Marshall in 1890: When the price of a product rises, people tend to buy less of it; when the price of a product falls, people tend to buy more.Theories do not always arise out of formal numerical data. All of us have been observing people’s behavior and their responses to economic stimuli for most of our lives. We may have observed our parents’ reaction to a sudden increase—or decrease—in income or to the loss of a job or the acquisition of a new one. We all have seen people standing in line waiting for a bargain. Of course, our own actions and reactions are another important source of data.Theories and ModelsIn many disciplines, including physics, chemistry, meteorology, political science, and economics, theorists build formal models of behavior. A model is a formal statement of a theory. It is usually a mathematical statement of a presumed relationship between two or more variables.A variable is a measure that can change from time to time or from observation to observa- tion. Income is a variable—it has different values for different people and different values for the same person at different times. The rental price of a movie on a DVD is a variable; it has different values at different stores and at different times. There are countless other examples.Because all models simplify reality by stripping part of it away, they are abstractions. Critics of economics often point to abstraction as a weakness. Most economists, however, see abstraction as a real strength.The describe phenomena and facts.compilation of data thateconomic theoryA statement or set of relatedstatements about cause and effect, action and reaction.model A formal statement of a theory, usually a mathematical statement of a presumed relationship between two or more variables.variable A measure that can change from time to time or from observation to observation.
The easiest way to see how abstraction can be helpful is to think of a map. A map is a repre- sentation of reality that is simplified and abstract. A city or state appears on a piece of paper as a series of lines and colors. The amount of reality that the mapmaker can strip away before the map loses something essential depends on what the map will be used for. If you want to drive from St. Louis to Phoenix, you need to know only the major interstate highways and roads. You lose absolutely nothing and gain clarity by cutting out the local streets and roads. However, if you need to get around Phoenix, you may need to see every street and alley.Most maps are two-dimensional representations of a three-dimensional world; they show where roads and highways go but do not show hills and valleys along the way. Trail maps for hikers, however, have “contour lines” that represent changes in elevation. When you are in a car, changes in elevation matter very little; they would make a map needlessly complex and more difficult to read. However, if you are on foot carrying a 50-pound pack, a knowledge of elevation is crucial.Like maps, economic models are abstractions that strip away detail to expose only those aspects of behavior that are important to the question being asked. The principle that irrelevant detail should be cut away is called the principle of Ockham’s razor after the fourteenth-century philosopher William of Ockham.Be careful—although abstraction is a powerful tool for exposing and analyzing specific aspects of behavior, it is possible to oversimplify. Economic models often strip away a good deal of social and political reality to get at underlying concepts. When an economic theory is used to help formulate actual government or institutional policy, political and social reality must often be reintroduced if the policy is to have a chance of working.The key here is that the appropriate amount of simplification and abstraction depends on the use to which the model will be put. To return to the map example: You do not want to walk around San Francisco with a map made for drivers—there are too many very steep hills.All Else Equal: Ceteris Paribus It is usually true that whatever you want to explain with a model depends on more than one factor. Suppose, for example, that you want to explain the total number of miles driven by automobile owners in the United States. The number of miles driven will change from year to year or month to month; it is a variable. The issue, if we want to under- stand and explain changes that occur, is what factors cause those changes.Obviously, many things might affect total miles driven. First, more or fewer people may be driving. This number, in turn, can be affected by changes in the driving age, by population growth, or by changes in state laws. Other factors might include the price of gasoline, the house- hold’s income, the number and age of children in the household, the distance from home to work, the location of shopping facilities, and the availability and quality of public transport. When any of these variables change, the members of the household may drive more or less. If changes in any of these variables affect large numbers of households across the country, the total number of miles driven will change.Very often we need to isolate or separate these effects. For example, suppose we want to know the impact on driving of a higher tax on gasoline. This change would raise the price of gasoline at the pump but would not (at least in the short run) affect income, workplace location, number of children, and so on.To isolate the impact of one single factor, we use the device of ceteris paribus, or all else equal. We ask, “What is the impact of a change in gasoline price on driving behavior, ceteris paribus, or assuming that nothing else changes?” If gasoline prices rise by 10 percent, how much less driving will there be, assuming no simultaneous change in anything else—that is, assuming that income, number of children, population, laws, and so on, all remain constant? Using the device of ceteris paribus is one part of the process of abstraction. In formulating economic theory, the concept helps us simplify reality to focus on the relationships that interest us.Expressing Models in Words, Graphs, and Equations Consider the following statements: Lower airline ticket prices cause people to fly more frequently. Higher interest rates slow the rate of home sales. When firms produce more output, employment increases. Higher gasoline prices cause people to drive less and to buy more fuel-efficient cars.Ockham’s razor The principle that irrelevant detail should be cut away.CHAPTER 1 The Scope and Method of Economics 11ceteris paribus, or all else equal A device used to analyze the relationship between two variables while the values of other variables are held unchanged.
12 PART IIntroduction to Economicspost hoc, ergo propter hocLiterally, “after this (in time), therefore because of this.” A common error made in thinking about causation: If Event A happens before Event B, it is not necessarily true that A caused B.Each of those statements expresses a relationship between two variables that can be quanti- fied. In each case, there is a stimulus and a response, a cause and an effect. Quantitative relation- ships can be expressed in a variety of ways. Sometimes words are sufficient to express the essence of a theory, but often it is necessary to be more specific about the nature of a relationship or about the size of a response. The most common method of expressing the quantitative relation- ship between two variables is graphing that relationship on a two-dimensional plane. In fact, we will use graphic analysis extensively in Chapter 2 and beyond. Because it is essential that you be familiar with the basics of graphing, the appendix to this chapter presents a careful review of graphing techniques.Quantitative relationships between variables can also be presented through equations. For example, suppose we discovered that over time, U.S. households collectively spend, or consume, 90 percent of their income and save 10 percent of their income. We could then write:C = .90 Y and S = .10Ywhere C is consumption spending, Y is income, and S is saving. Writing explicit algebraic expres- sions like these helps us understand the nature of the underlying process of decision making. Understanding this process is what economics is all about.Cautions and Pitfalls In formulating theories and models, it is especially important to avoid two pitfalls: the post hoc fallacy and the fallacy of composition.The Post Hoc Fallacy Theories often make statements or sets of statements about cause and effect. It can be quite tempting to look at two events that happen in sequence and assume that the first caused the second to happen. This is not always the case. This common error is called the post hoc, ergo propter hoc (or “after this, therefore because of this”) fallacy.There are thousands of examples. The Colorado Rockies have won seven games in a row. Last night you went to the game and they lost. You must have jinxed them. They lost because you went to the game.Stock market analysts indulge in what is perhaps the most striking example of the post hoc fallacy in action. Every day the stock market goes up or down, and every day some analyst on some national news program singles out one or two of the day’s events as the cause of some change in the market: “Today the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5 points on heavy trading; analysts say that the increase was due to progress in talks between Israel and Syria.” Research has shown that daily changes in stock market averages are very largely random. Although major news events clearly have a direct influence on certain stock prices, most daily changes cannot be linked directly to specific news stories.Very closely related to the post hoc fallacy is the often erroneous link between correlation and causation. Two variables are said to be correlated if one variable changes when the other variable changes. However, correlation does not imply causation. Cities that have high crime rates also have many automobiles, so there is a very high degree of correlation between number of cars and crime rates. Can we argue, then, that cars cause crime? No. The reason for the corre- lation may have nothing to do with cause and effect. Big cities have many people, many people have many cars; therefore, big cities have many cars. Big cities also have high crime rates for many reasons—crowding, poverty, anonymity, unequal distribution of wealth, and readily avail- able drugs, to mention only a few. However, the presence of cars is probably not one of them.This caution must also be viewed in reverse. Sometimes events that seem entirely uncon- nected actually are connected. In 1978, Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts ran for reelection. Still quite popular, Dukakis was nevertheless defeated in the Democratic primary that year by a razor-thin margin. The weekend before, the Boston Red Sox, in the thick of the division championship race, had been badly beaten by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Some very respectable political analysts believe that hundreds of thousands of Boston sports fans vented their anger on the incumbent governor the following Tuesday.
The Fallacy of Composition To conclude that what is true for a part is necessarily true for the whole is to fall into the fallacy of composition. Suppose that a large group of cattle ranchers graze their cattle on the same range. To an individual rancher, more cattle and more grazing mean a higher income. However, because its capacity is limited, the land can support only so many cattle. If every cattle rancher increased the number of cattle sent out to graze, the land would become overgrazed and barren; as a result, everyone’s income would fall. In short, theories that seem to work well when applied to individuals or households often break down when they are applied to the whole.Testing Theories and Models: Empirical Economics In science, a theory is rejected when it fails to explain what is observed or when another theory better explains what is observed. The collection and use of data to test economic theories is called empirical economics.Numerous large data sets are available to facilitate economic research. For example, econ- omists studying the labor market can now test behavioral theories against the actual working experiences of thousands of randomly selected people who have been surveyed continuously since the 1960s. Macroeconomists continuously monitoring and studying the behavior of the national economy at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) pass thousands of items of data, collected by both government agencies and private companies, over the Internet.In the natural sciences, controlled experiments, typically done in the lab, are a standard way of testing theories. In recent years, economics has seen an increase in the use of experiments, both in the field and in the lab, as a tool to test its theories. One economist, John List of Chicago, tested the effect of changing the way an auction was run on bid prices for rare baseball cards with the help of the sports memorabilia dealers in trade show. (The experiment used a standard Cal Ripkin Jr. card.) Another economist, Keith Chen of Yale, has used experiments with monkeys to investigate the deeper biological roots of human decision making. The Economics in Practice on p. 9 describes another experiment on trust and gender.Economic PolicyEconomic theory helps us understand how the world works, but the formulation of economic policy requires a second step. We must have objectives. What do we want to change? Why? What is good and what is bad about the way the system is operating? Can we make it better?Such questions force us to be specific about the grounds for judging one outcome superior to another. What does it mean to be better? Four criteria are frequently applied in judging eco- nomic outcomes:1. Efficiency 2. Equity3. Growth 4. StabilityEfficiency In physics, “efficiency” refers to the ratio of useful energy delivered by a system to the energy supplied to it. An efficient automobile engine, for example, is one that uses a small amount of fuel per mile for a given level of power.In economics, efficiency means allocative efficiency. An efficient economy is one that pro- duces what people want at the least possible cost. If the system allocates resources to the produc- tion of goods and services that nobody wants, it is inefficient. If all members of a particular society were vegetarians and somehow half of all that society’s resources were used to produce meat, the result would be inefficient. It is inefficient when steel beams lie in the rain and rust because somebody fouled up a shipping schedule. If a firm could produce its product using 25 percent less labor and energy without sacrificing quality, it too is inefficient.The clearest example of an efficient change is a voluntary exchange. If you and I each want something that the other has and we agree to exchange, we are both better off and nofallacy of composition The erroneous belief that what is true for a part is necessarily true for the whole.empirical economics The collection and use of data to test economic theories.CHAPTER 1 The Scope and Method of Economics 13efficiencyIn economics, allocative efficiency.

When a company reorganizes its production or adopts a new technology that enables it to produce more of its product with fewer resources, without sacrificing quality, it has made an efficient change. At least potentially, the resources saved could be used to pro- duce more of something.Inefficiencies can arise in numerous ways. Sometimes they are caused by government regula- tions or tax laws that distort otherwise sound economic decisions. Suppose that land in Ohio is best suited for corn production and that land in Kansas is best suited for wheat production. A law that requires Kansas to produce only corn and Ohio to produce only wheat would be inefficient. If firms that cause environmental damage are not held accountable for their actions, the incentive to minimize those damages is lost and the result is inefficient.In Figure II.1, much of the detail of the real world is stripped away just as it is on a highway map. A map is a highly simplified version of reality, but it is a very useful tool when you need to know where you are. Figure II.1 is intended to serve as a map to help you understand basic market forces before we add more complicated market structures and government.Before we proceed with our discussion of household choice, we need to make a few basic assumptions. These assumptions pertain to Chapters 6 through 12.We first assume that households and firms possess all the information they need to make market choices. Specifically, we assume that households possess knowledge of the qualities and prices of everything available in the market. Firms know all that there is to know about wage rates, capital costs, and output prices. This assumption is often called the assumption of perfect knowledge.The next assumption is perfect competition. Perfect competition is a precisely defined form of industry structure. (The word perfect here does not refer to virtue. It simply means “total” or “complete.”) In a perfectly competitive industry, no single firm has control over prices. That is, no single firm is large enough to affect the market price of its product or the prices of the inputs that it buys. This follows from two characteristics of competitive indus- tries. First, a competitive industry is composed of many firms, each one small relative to the size of the industry. Second, every firm in a perfectly competitive industry produces exactly the same product; the output of one firm cannot be distinguished from the output of the others. Products in a perfectly competitive industry are said to be homogeneous.These characteristics limit the decisions open to competitive firms and simplify the analysis of competitive behavior. Because all firms in a perfectly competitive industry pro- duce virtually identical products and because each firm is small relative to the market, per- fectly competitive firms have no control over the prices at which they sell their output. By taking prices as a given, each firm can decide only how much output to produce and how to produce it.Consider agriculture, the classic example of a perfectly competitive industry. A wheat farmer in South Dakota has absolutely no control over the price of wheat. Prices are deter- mined not by the individual farmers, but by the interaction of many suppliers and many demanders. The only decisions left to the wheat farmer are how much wheat to plant and when and how to produce the crop.We finally assume that each household is small relative to the size of the market. Households face a set of product prices that they individually cannot control. Prices again are set by the interaction of many suppliers and many demanders.By the end of Chapter 10, we will have a complete picture of an economy, but it will be based on this set of fairly restrictive assumptions. At first, this may seem unrealistic to you, but keep the following in mind. Much of the economic analysis in the chapters that follow applies to all forms of market structure. Indeed, much of the power of economic reasoning is that it is quite general. As we continue in microeconomics, in Chapters 13 and 14, we will define and explore several different kinds of market organization and structure, including monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. Because monopolists, oligopolists, monopolistic competitors, and perfect competitors share the objective of maximizing prof- its, it should not be surprising that their behavior is in many ways similar. We focus here on perfect competition because many of these basic principles are easier to learn using the sim- plest of cases.Every day people in a market econ-omy make decisions. Some of thosedecisions involve the products theyplan to buy: Should you buy a Cokefor lunch, a bottle of tea, or justdrink water? Should you purchase alaptop computer or stick with yourold desktop? Some decisions areabout the labor market: Should youcontinue your schooling or go towork instead? If you do start work-ing, how much should you work?Should you work more when youget a raise or just take it easy? Manydecisions involve a time element. Ifor borrow money. That will leave you with fewer choices about what you can buy in the future. On the other hand, the laptop itself is an investment.To many people, the decisions listed in the previous paragraph seem very different from one another. As you will see in this chapter, however, from an economics perspective, these decisions have a great deal in common. In this chapter, we will develop a set of principles that can be used to under- stand decisions in the product market and the labor market—decisions for today and for the future.As you read this chapter, you might want to think about some of the following questions, ques- tions that you will be able to answer by chapter’s end. Baseball, even when it was more popular than it is today, was never played year-round. Indeed, no professional sport has a year-round season. Is this break necessary to give the athletes a rest, or is there something about household choice that helps explain this pattern? When the price of gasoline rises, people drive less, but one study suggests that they also switch from brand name products to generics or store brands.1 Why might this be? Studying household choice will help you understand many decisions that underpin our market economy.A constant theme that will run through the analysis is the idea of constrained choice. That is, the decisions that we make we make under constraints that exist in the marketplace. Household consumption choices are constrained by income, wealth, and existing prices. Household deci- sions about labor supply and job choice are clearly constrained by the availability of jobs. This was on everyone’s minds when the number of unemployed reached 15 million and the unem- ployment rate hovered at about 10 percent during the 2009–2010 period. In addition, the choices we make in the workforce are constrained by the existing structure of market wages.
A careful search of the housing market reveals four vacant apartments. The least expensive is a one-room studio with a small kitchenette that rents for $400 per month, including utilities (option A). If she lived there, Barbara could afford to spend $250 per month on food and still have $350 left over for other things.About four blocks away is a one-bedroom apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting and a larger kitchen. It has more space, but the rent is $600, including utilities. If Barbara took this apartment, she might cut her food expenditures by $50 per month and have only $200 per month left for everything else.In the same building as the one-bedroom apartment is an identical unit on the top floor of the building with a balcony facing west toward the sunset. The balcony and view add $100 to the monthly rent. To live there, Barbara would be left with only $300 to split between food and other expenses.Just because she was curious, Barbara looked at a town house in the suburbs that was renting for $1,000 per month. Obviously, unless she could get along without eating or doing anything else that cost money, she could not afford it. The combination of the town house and any amount of food is outside her budget constraint.Notice that we have used the information that we have on income and prices to identify dif- ferent combinations of housing, food, and other items that are available to a single-person house- hold with an income of $1,000 per month. We have said nothing about the process of choosing. Instead, we have carved out what is called a choice set or opportunity set, the set of options that is defined and limited by Barbara’s budget constraint.Preferences, Tastes, Trade-Offs, and Opportunity Cost So far, we have identi- fied only the combinations of goods and services that are and are not available to Barbara. Within the constraints imposed by limited incomes and fixed prices, however, households are free to choose what they will and will not buy. Their ultimate choices are governed by their individual preferences and tastes.It will help you to think of the household choice process as a process of allocating income over a large number of available goods and services. Final demand of a household for any single product is just one of many outcomes that result from the decision-making process. Think, for example, of a demand curve that shows a household’s reaction to a drop in the price of air travel. During certain periods when people travel less frequently, special fares flood the market and many people decide to take trips that they otherwise would not have taken. However, if you live in Florida and decide to spend $400 to visit your mother in Nashville, you cannot spend that $400 on new clothes, dinners at restaurants, or a new set of tires.A change in the price of a single good changes the constraints within which households choose, and this may change the entire allocation of income. Demand for some goods and services may rise while demand for others falls. A complicated set of trade-offs lies behind the shape and position of a household demand curve for a single good. Whenever a household makes a choice, it is weighing the good or service that it chooses against all the other things that the same money could buy.Consider again our young account manager and her options listed in Table 6.1. If she hates to cook, likes to eat at restaurants, and goes out three nights a week, she will probably trade off some housing for dinners out and money to spend on clothes and other things. She will probably rent the studio for $400. She may, however, love to spend long evenings at home reading, listen- ing to classical music, and sipping tea while watching the sunset. In that case, she will probably trade off some restaurant meals, evenings out, and travel expenses for the added comfort of the larger apartment with the balcony and the view. As long as a household faces a limited budget— and all households ultimately do—the real cost of any good or service is the value of the other goods and services that could have been purchased with the same amount of money. The real cost of a good or service is its opportunity cost, and opportunity cost is determined by relative prices.The Budget Constraint More Formally Ann and Tom are struggling graduate stu- dents in economics at the University of Virginia. Their tuition is paid by graduate fellowships. They live as resident advisers in a first-year dormitory, in return for which they receive an apart- ment and meals. Their fellowships also give them $200 each month to cover all their other expenses. To simplify things, let us assume that Ann and Tom spend their money on only two things: meals at a local Thai restaurant and nights at a local jazz club, The Hungry Ear. Thai meals go for a fixed price of $20 per couple. Two tickets to the jazz club, including espresso, are $10.As Figure 6.1 shows, we can graphically depict the choices that are available to our dynamic duo. The axes measure the quantities of the two goods that Ann and Tom buy. The horizontal axischoice set or opportunityset The set of options that is defined and limited by a budget constraint.
The reason we take opportunity costs into account is that we are interested in analyzing the behavior of firms from the standpoint of a potential investor or a potential new competitor. If I am thinking about buying a firm or shares in a firm or entering an industry as a new firm, I need to consider the full costs of production. For example, if a family business employs three family members but pays them no wage, there is still a cost: the opportunity cost of their labor. In eval- uating the business from the outside, these costs must be added if we want to figure out whether the business is successful.The most important opportunity cost that is included in economic cost is the opportunity cost of capital. The way we treat the opportunity cost of capital is to add a normal rate of return to capital as part of economic cost.Normal Rate of Return When someone decides to start a firm, that person must com- mit resources. To operate a manufacturing firm, you need a plant and some equipment. To start a restaurant, you need to buy grills, ovens, tables, chairs, and so on. In other words, you must invest in capital. To start an e-business, you need a host site, some computer equipment, some software, and a Web-site design. Such investment requires resources that stay tied up in the firm as long as it operates. Even firms that have been around a long time must continue to invest. Plant and equipment wear out and must be replaced. Firms that decide to expand must put new capital in place. This is as true of proprietorships, where the resources come directly from the proprietor, as it is of corporations, where the resources needed to make investments come from shareholders.Whenever resources are used to invest in a business, there is an opportunity cost. Instead of opening a candy store, you could put your funds into an alternative use such as a certificate of deposit or a government bond, both of which earn interest. Instead of using its retained earnings to build a new plant, a firm could earn interest on those funds or pay them out to shareholders.Rate of return is the annual flow of net income generated by an investment expressed as a percentage of the total investment. For example, if someone makes a $100,000 investment in cap- ital to start a small restaurant and the restaurant produces a flow of profit of $15,000 every year, we say the project has a “rate of return” of 15 percent. Sometimes we refer to the rate of return as the yield of the investment.A normal rate of return is the rate that is just sufficient to keep owners and investors satis- fied. If the rate of return were to fall below normal, it would be difficult or impossible for managers to raise resources needed to purchase new capital. Owners of the firm would be receiving a rate of return that was lower than what they could receive elsewhere in the economy, and they would have no incentive to invest in the firm.If the firm has fairly steady revenues and the future looks secure, the normal rate of return should be very close to the interest rate on risk-free government bonds. A firm cer- tainly will not keep investors interested in it if it does not pay them a rate of return at least as high as they can get from a risk-free government or corporate bond. If a firm is rock solid and the economy is steady, it may not have to pay a much higher rate. However, if a firm is in a very speculative industry and the future of the economy is shaky, it may have to pay sub- stantially more to keep its shareholders happy. In exchange for a risk that the business may fal- ter or even fail, the shareholders will expect a higher return.A normal rate of return is considered a part of the total cost of a business. Adding a normal rate of return to total cost has an important implication: When a firm earns a normal rate of return, it is earning a zero profit as we have defined profit. If the level of profit is positive, the firm is earning an above-normal rate of return on capital.A simple example will illustrate the concepts of a normal rate of return being part of total cost. Suppose that Sue and Ann decide to start a small business selling turquoise belts in the Denver airport. To get into the business, they need to invest in a fancy pushcart. The price of the pushcart is $20,000 with all the displays and attachments included. Suppose that Sue and Ann estimate that they will sell 3,000 belts each year for $10 each. Further assume that each belt costs $5 from the supplier. Finally, the cart must be staffed by one clerk, who works for an annual wage of $14,000. Is this business going to make a profit?To answer this question, we must determine total revenue and total cost. First, annual rev- enue is $30,000 (3,000 belts 􏰈 $10). Total cost includes the cost of the belts—$15,000 (3,000 belts 􏰈 $5)—plus the labor cost of $14,000, for a total of $29,000. Thus, on the basis of the annual rev- enue and cost flows, the firm seems to be making a profit of $1,000 ($30,000 - $29,000).normal rate of returnCHAPTER 7 The Production Process: The Behavior of Profit-Maximizing Firms149A rate of return on capital that is justsufficient to keep owners and investors satisfied. For relatively risk-free firms, it should be nearly the same as the interest rate on risk-free government bonds.
150 PART IIThe Market System: Choices Made by Households and FirmsWhat about the $20,000 initial investment in the pushcart? This investment is not a direct part of the cost of Sue and Ann’s firm. If we assume that the cart maintains its value over time, the only thing that Sue and Ann are giving up is the interest they might have earned had they not tied up their funds in the pushcart. That is, the only real cost is the opportunity cost of the investment, which is the forgone interest on the $20,000.Now suppose that Sue and Ann want a minimum return equal to 10 percent—which is, say, the rate of interest that they could have gotten by purchasing corporate bonds. This implies a nor- mal return of 10 percent, or $2,000 annually (= $20,000 􏰈 0.10) on the $20,000 investment. As we determined earlier, Sue and Ann will earn only $1,000 annually. This is only a 5 percent return on their investment. Thus, they are really earning a below-normal return. Recall that the opportunity cost of capital must be added to total cost in calculating profit. Thus, the total cost in this case is $31,000 ($29,000 + $2,000 in forgone interest on the investment). The level of profit is negative: $30,000 minus $31,000 equals –$1,000. These calculations are summarized in Table 7.1. Because the level of profit is negative, Sue and Ann are actually suffering a loss on their belt business.
The decisions made by a firm—how much to produce, how to produce it, and what inputs to demand—all take time into account. If a firm decides that it wants to double or triple its output, it may need time to arrange financing, hire architects and contractors, and build a new plant. Planning for a major expansion can take years. In the meantime, the firm must decide how much to produce within the constraint of its existing plant. If a firm decides to get out of a particular business, it may take time to arrange an orderly exit. There may be contract obligations to fulfill, equipment to sell, and so on. Once again, the firm must decide what to do in the meantime.A firm’s immediate response to a change in the economic environment may differ from its response over time. Consider, for example, a small restaurant with 20 tables that becomes very popular. The immediate problem for the owners is getting the most profit within the constraint of the existing restaurant. The owner might consider adding a few tables or speeding up service to squeeze in a few more customers. Some popular restaurants do not take reservations, forcing people to wait at the bar. This practice increases drink revenues and keeps tables full at all times. At the same time, the owner may be thinking of expanding the current facility, moving to a larger facility, or opening a second restaurant. In the future, the owner might buy the store next door and double the capacity. Such decisions might require negotiating a lease, buying new equip- ment, and hiring more staff. It takes time to make and implement these decisions.
Because the character of immediate response differs from long-run adjustment, it is useful to define two time periods: the short run and the long run. Two assumptions define the short run: (1) a fixed scale (or a fixed factor of production) and (2) no entry into or exit from the industry. First, the short run is defined as that period during which existing firms have some fixed factor of production—that is, during which time some factor locks them into their current scale of opera- tions. Second, new firms cannot enter and existing firms cannot exit an industry in the short run. Firms may curtail operations, but they are still locked into some costs even though they may be in the process of going out of business.Which factor or factors of production are fixed in the short run differs from industry to industry. For a manufacturing firm, the size of the physical plant is often the greatest limitation. A factory is built with a given production rate in mind. Although that rate can be increased, out- put cannot increase beyond a certain limit in the short run. For a private physician, the limit may be the capacity to see patients; the day has only so many hours. In the long run, the doctor may invite others to join the practice and expand; but for now, in the short run, this sole physician is the firm, with a capacity that is the firm’s only capacity. For a farmer, the fixed factor may be land. The capacity of a small farm is limited by the number of acres being cultivated.In the long run, there are no fixed factors of production. Firms can plan for any output level they find desirable. They can double or triple output, for example. In addition, new firms can start up operations (enter the industry) and existing firms can go out of business (exit the industry).No hard-and-fast rule specifies how long the short run is. The point is that firms make two basic kinds of decisions: those that govern the day-to-day operations of the firm and those that involve longer-term strategic planning. Sometimes major decisions can be implemented in weeks. Often, however, the process takes years. In many large firms, different people often make the short- and long-run decisions. A production manager might well be charged with trying to do the best she can with the plant and equipment that she has, while her boss, the division head, figures out whether expansion of the plant is a good idea. In a single proprietorship, one person may wear both hats, thinking simultaneously about how to make the most out of the present while taking steps to improve the future of the business.The Bases of Decisions: Market Price of Outputs, AvailableTechnology, and Input PricesAs we said earlier, a firm’s three fundamental decisions are made with the objective of maximiz- ing profits. Because profits equal total revenues minus total costs, each firm needs to know how much it costs to produce its product and how much its product can be sold for.To know how much it costs to produce a good or service, a firm needs to know something about the production techniques that are available and about the prices of the inputs required. To estimate how much it will cost to operate a gas station, for instance, a firm needs to know equipment needs, number of workers, kind of building, and so on. The firm also needs to know the going wage rates for mechanics and unskilled laborers, the cost of gas pumps, interest rates, the rents per square foot of land on high-traffic corners, and the whole- sale price of gasoline. Of course, the firm also needs to know how much it can sell gasoline and repair services for.In the language of economics, a firm needs to know three things:1. Themarketpriceofoutput2. Thetechniquesofproductionthatareavailable 3. ThepricesofinputsOutput price determines potential revenues. The techniques available tell me how much of each input I need, and input prices tell me how much they will cost. Together the available production techniques and the prices of inputs determine costs.The rest of this chapter and the next chapter focus on costs of production. We begin at the heart of the firm, with the production process. Faced with a set of input prices, firms must decide on the best, or optimal, method of production (Figure 7.2). The optimal method of production is the one that minimizes cost. With cost determined and the market price of output known, a firm will make a final judgment about the quantity of product to produce and the quantity of each input to demand.
